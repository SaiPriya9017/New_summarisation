**Multi-News Summarizer & Fact Extractor Using Gemini Pro and Web Scraping**

---

**Abstract**
In today's era of information overload, individuals are frequently confronted with incomplete, biased, or conflicting news reports across various platforms. This work proposes an AI-powered web application that utilizes Google's Gemini Pro large language model for abstractive summarization, alongside BeautifulSoup for web scraping and fact extraction. The system provides individual article summaries and synthesizes key insights from multiple sources to produce a concise, composite overview. Built using Streamlit, the application offers an interactive and user-friendly interface, benefiting researchers, analysts, and general readers seeking clarity from complex or contradictory news stories.

**1. Introduction**
In a rapidly evolving and knowledge-intensive world, users are inundated with a deluge of information from social media, blogs, and news websites. This constant stream of high-velocity content makes it increasingly difficult to identify trustworthy and relevant news in real time. As a response to this challenge, we propose an intelligent news summarization system that leverages real-time web scraping for data acquisition and Google's Gemini Pro model for advanced summarization.

The system is designed to reduce users' cognitive load by presenting brief, coherent, and contextually rich descriptions of lengthy news articles. Web scraping enables the automated extraction of articles from reputable sources such as CNN, BBC, and Reuters. After preprocessing to eliminate extraneous elements like ads and scripts, the refined content is passed to Gemini Pro. This state-of-the-art large language model produces abstractive summaries that preserve factual accuracy and contextual depth.

Gemini Pro's strengths—contextual understanding, inference capability, and information synthesis—make it ideal for multi-source summarization. By integrating it with live data scraping, the system delivers up-to-date and factually consistent news summaries. This paper details the system architecture, implementation, evaluation metrics, and comparative results with traditional models, establishing a foundation for innovations in digital journalism and automated content aggregation.

**Research Questions**

* How can AI automate salient point extraction across diverse news sources?
* What are the most effective metrics for evaluating source reliability and fact consistency?
* How does Gemini Pro compare to traditional NLP models (e.g., BERT) in identifying and mitigating bias?
* Can visualizations (e.g., geospatial maps, timelines) enhance user comprehension and bias detection?
* What are the most accurate measures of bias in news summaries (e.g., sentiment polarity, source diversity)?
* How does the system handle contradictions between high- and low-credibility sources?
* Can the model detect nuanced misinformation (e.g., cherry-picking) beyond overt factual contradictions?
* Does incorporating diverse sources reduce regional or narrative bias in summaries?
* How do Gemini Pro-generated summaries compare to human-written digests in terms of readability and credibility?
* Can interactive visuals help users track the evolution of media bias over time?

**2. Literature Review**
Text summarization has long been a focus within NLP, traditionally categorized into extractive (selecting exact sentences) and abstractive (paraphrasing content) approaches. The field has significantly evolved with the introduction of neural networks and transformer architectures.

Rush et al. (2015) introduced an attention-based encoder-decoder framework for summarization. See et al. (2017) enhanced this model with pointer-generator networks, improving factual consistency. Vaswani et al. (2017) proposed the Transformer architecture, foundational to models like BERT, GPT, and T5. Liu and Lapata (2019) presented BERTSUM, applying pretrained transformers for extractive summarization.

Lewis et al. (2020) proposed BART, a denoising autoencoder model excelling in CNN/DailyMail datasets. PEGASUS by Zhang et al. (2020) used sentence masking to pretrain summarization-specific models. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) introduced general-purpose language models that excelled in few-shot summarization.

Despite these advancements, most summarization models rely on static datasets. This research bridges that gap by combining Gemini Pro's real-time summarization capabilities with dynamic data scraping, enabling live and adaptive content generation.

**3. System Architecture**
The system automates end-to-end news summarization through four interconnected modules:

**1. Web Scraping Module**
Utilizes libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Firecrawl to extract news articles from sources (title, date, author, content) using the page’s HTML structure.
**Input:** News URL
**Output:** Raw HTML content

**2. Preprocessing Module**
Cleans and normalizes HTML data by:

* Removing scripts, ads, and boilerplate
* Normalizing characters and whitespaces
* Converting HTML to plain text
* Tokenizing sentences
  **Input:** Raw HTML
  **Output:** Cleaned text

**3. LLM Summarization Module**
Passes cleaned text to the Gemini Pro API, which generates 3–4 sentence abstractive summaries. Prompts are tailored for tone, length, and context to ensure clarity and factual accuracy.
**Input:** Preprocessed text
**Output:** Summary text

**4. Evaluation and Output Module**
Presents summaries via an intuitive Streamlit UI. Evaluates outputs using automated metrics and human scoring (fluency, informativeness, and relevance).
**Input:** Generated summaries
**Output:** Displayed summaries with scores

*System architecture diagram can be included as a flowchart.*

**4. Evaluation Metrics**

**4.1 ROUGE**
Measures overlap with reference summaries:

* **ROUGE-1:** Unigram match (key terms)
* **ROUGE-2:** Bigram match (fluency and cohesion)
* **ROUGE-L:** Longest common subsequence (sentence structure)

**4.2 BLEU**
Assesses n-gram precision (BLEU-1 to BLEU-4), penalizing overly short outputs. Though originally for translation, it also measures syntactic and lexical quality in summaries.

**4.3 Human Evaluation**
Three human-evaluated dimensions:

* **Fluency:** Grammaticality and readability
* **Relevance:** Captures core information
* **Informativeness:** Completeness and usefulness

**4.4 Evaluation Process and Dataset**
500 articles from domains like politics, science, health, and tech were summarized using Gemini Pro and compared to outputs from TextRank and GPT-3. Human-generated summaries (where available) were used as benchmarks.

**Performance Scores:**

* **ROUGE-1:** 0.58
* **ROUGE-2:** 0.42
* **BLEU-4:** 0.41
* **Human Fluency Score:** 4.5/5

Gemini Pro outperformed traditional models in both recall-based and precision-based evaluations, confirming its robustness in factual summarization and readability.
